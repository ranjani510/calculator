# calculator
The code implements a Scientific Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. It offers two modes:
 Basic Mode: Handles standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and additional basic functions like square, square root, and modulus.
 Scientific Mode: Adds advanced mathematical operations like trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), exponential calculations, logarithms, factorial, and constants like Ï€ and e.
 Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Dynamically switches between dark and light modes for the interface, changing background and text colors.
 History Tracking: A history area on the right stores past calculations.
 Memory Functions: Includes MC (clear memory), MR (recall memory), and M+/M- (add/subtract from memory).
